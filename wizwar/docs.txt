  /* 
    Scoring rules:

    The five elements on the board and the two in your hand
    combine to make your gestalt.

    Having more of the same element creates a higher ranked
    gestalt. For example, a gestalt with 3 Fire beats all
    gestalts with less than 3 of any one element,
    and a gestalt with 5 Ice beats all gestalts with less
    than 5 of any one element.

    Multiples of the highest grouping are worth more,
    so a gestalt with 3 Ice and 3 Earth will beat one
    with only 3 Ice.

    Further ties are settled by applying the same rules
    to the remainder, so a gestalt of 3 Light,
    2 Air, and 2 Water will beat a gestalt of 3 Fire and 
    2 Dark, because the first gestalt has more pairs.

    There are 49 (7 x 7) elements and 3 additional cards:

    2 Voids
    1 Gold

    Double Void beats all others gestalts. Players
    tied with Double Voids are ranked by the rest
    of their gestalts as normal.

    The Gold orb wins when otherwise tied.
